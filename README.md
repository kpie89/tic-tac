# Kevin Pie Tic-Tac-Toe game

## Game

http://kpie89.github.io/tic-tac/

This is a tic-tac-toe game built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, SCSS and Bootstrap. The purpose of the game is to get either 3 X's or 3 O's in a row in order to win.

## User Stories
-As a user I should be able to sign-up, sign-in, change my password and log out.
-A user, during gameplay can click a square expecting to see an X or an O.
-A user, when they have successfully won, can expect the win to be displayed and accounted for.

## About
The main challenge I struggled with during this process was making sense of the game logic and getting it to perform correctly. There is still so much for me to learn about CSS styling and using bootstrap to produce a more esthetically pleasing app. If I had more time, I would refactor my code in order to be more succinct and easier to read. I would also work more with CSS and bootstrap to give the game page more bells and whistles.
