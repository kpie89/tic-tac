## Game

This is a tic-tac-toe game built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. The purpose of the game is to get either 3 X's or 3 O's in a row in order to win.

## User Stories

-A user, during gameplay can click a square expecting to see an X or an O.
-A user, when they have successfully won, can expect the win to be displayed and accounted for.

## About
The main things that I struggled with during this process was getting the game logic to make sense and do what it was supposed to do.  There is also much I can still learn about CSS stylings and using bootstrap to produce a much prettier app.
If I had more time, I would refactor my code so it is more succint and easier to read. I would also work more with CSS and bootstrap to give the game page more bells and whistles.
